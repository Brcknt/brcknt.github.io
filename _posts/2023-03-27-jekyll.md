This website you're looking at right now is the culmination of my learnign to use Jekyll. Whiel looking at the documentation for Github pages, which is how this site is hosted, I discovered Jekyll, a static-site generator. What this means is that instead of having to copy over any code between different pages I create, and keep track of any changes across the differnet pages, I can instead create a number of smaller "modules" that will then be combined into a complete static website.

Static websites are very good for performance as for each page, there are fewer requests to the host server, with mose of the resources a page needs to function already automatically packed in.

This approach also makes a blog structure exceptionally easy. Without Jekyll, I'd have to manually update the page containing links to all of the posts every time i created a new one, and making changes to the website would be virtually impossible, having to forward any changes to every single post individually. With Jekyll, I can simply create a new markdown file (Much simpler than HTML), give it metadata like the title, date, and author, and a new page will automaticaslly be generated and added to the main page.
