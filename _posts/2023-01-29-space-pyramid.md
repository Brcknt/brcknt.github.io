This project was directly inspired by a Youtube video by CGMatter in which he shows a Rubix-cube-like object with all of its sides spinning randomly, using geometry nodes.

Shortly after I started learning Blender, I'd tried to create a looping animation with a similar shape, a pyramid that splits apart into the 4 pyramids and an octahedron while zooming in on the top one for the animation to loop. I wasn't particularly happy with the result. And the project ended there.

Drawing inspiration from both of these, I decided to undertake what was my largest geometry nodes project yet, A fractal pyramid that would split apart andd turn at random, using instances.

- I made each instance shrink, turn, and unshrink in a loop with a random speed and a random offset per-pyramid, needing layers of node groups

- made shader random for each element

- It was way more difficult thasn I planned
- I restarted a couple of times

- I made it space just because
