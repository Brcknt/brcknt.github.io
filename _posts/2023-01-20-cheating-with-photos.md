I'd been inspired by rewatching some stuff by Ian Hubert, in which he shows his workflow for how he creates 3D scenes, by taking photos of real-world surfaces that seem interesting, and using them as a basis for his assets, especially in the background. I myself have always preferred to use procedural materials for everything, as it avoids me having to do any UV unwrapping, and part of it has just always just felt “cleaner”, making everything myself totally from scratch.

I found the ease with which he seemed to just make things, not spending entire afternoons tweaking a brick material that just never looks right, inspiring, And not long later, I found myself in a few places with interesting surfaces to take photos of for this use.

I’d also recently come across Deepbump, an AI-based tool for generating normal and displacement maps for images, from a Default Cube tutorial, and was eager to try it out.

My scene was made from a few pictures of buildings I'd taken at Cockatoo Island in Sydney, imported as planes. I undistorted them to make the surfaces nice clean rectangles, then introduced loop cuts and extruded the most prominent details on the walls. I modelled out the arch and circular... well?... thing, and applied the brick material to them, and gave them some displacement. The scene wasn't meant to make sense or be coherent, just to play around with this photography-based workflow, and I was very happy with the results.
